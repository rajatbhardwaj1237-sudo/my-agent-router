# Agent Router

Multi-model routing layer for LLM workloads. Capability-aware routing, cost/latency optimization, fallback chains with cross-provider diversity, circuit breakers, sticky-session tenancy, and live routing telemetry.

> Recruiter takeaway:
>
> *"This person built the actual production routing layer most teams hand-roll badly. Capability-aware filtering, four optimization strategies (quality/cost/latency/balanced), proper circuit breakers with half-open semantics, and cross-provider failover. This is the thing that decides which LLM your traffic actually hits at runtime."*

## Why This Exists

Every AI team that ships at scale eventually builds a routing layer — it always starts as `if/else` matching prompt to model, evolves into a Slack channel of "Anthropic is down, switch to OpenAI," and ends as a tangled production fire. The routing layer is doing too many jobs: capability matching, cost optimization, latency caps, circuit breaking, fallback ordering, telemetry. Most teams build half of these and call it a day.

This repo is the version where all of those concerns are first-class, testable, and composable. Capability filter → score against optimization preference → check circuit-breaker availability → build cross-provider fallback chain → emit telemetry. The routing decision becomes a contract, not a prayer.

## Five Capabilities

### 1. Model Registry

Catalog of 12 backends across Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, Fireworks, and Cohere. Each entry tracks: capabilities (chat, reasoning, vision, agent, embedding, function-calling, long-context, code, image-gen, voice), cost (input/output USD per 1M tokens), observed p95 latency, max context, calibrated quality score, load-balancing weight, and preferred status.

### 2. Route Scorer

Four optimization profiles, each with explicit weights:

| Profile | Quality | Cost | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quality` | 70% | 10% | 20% |
| `cost` | 20% | 65% | 15% |
| `latency` | 20% | 10% | 70% |
| `balanced` | 40% | 30% | 30% |

Scoring runs a two-phase pipeline:

1. **Qualification** — exclude non-eligible backends (missing capabilities, context overflow, latency cap exceeded, cost cap exceeded, below quality floor, on excludelist, or non-preferred when `preferredOnly` is set).
2. **Scoring** — normalize quality/cost/latency across the qualified set, apply the optimization weights, add a small bonus for preferred backends.

Returns ranked candidates with full rationale per backend (why it scored what it scored, why disqualified ones were excluded).

### 3. Circuit Breaker

Three-state breaker per model — `closed`, `open`, `half-open`:

- **Closed**: normal routing
- **Open**: failures within rolling window exceeded threshold; backend skipped during routing
- **Half-open**: cooldown elapsed; backend gets probationary requests

Half-open semantics are correct: pre-trip failures are dropped on transition, but outcomes recorded after cooldown elapsed are kept. A failure in half-open re-opens immediately. Three successes (configurable) in half-open close the breaker.

### 4. Fallback Chain

Given the scored candidates, build an ordered chain to attempt:

| Rank | Role | Selection rule |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `primary` | Highest-scoring qualified backend |
| 2 | `failover-diff-provider` | Best from a different provider (default when `requireProviderDiversity` is true) |
| 3 | `last-resort` | Cheapest qualified candidate not yet in chain |

Cross-provider failover is the default — falling from Claude to Claude doesn't help when Anthropic is the issue.

### 5. Telemetry

Aggregates routing decisions over a window into: total decisions, unique tenants, unique models selected, fallback usage rate, top models by selection share, top tenants, optimization mix, p50/p95 cost + latency, total spend, average qualified-candidate count.

The telemetry is what tells you "we routed 73% of traffic to Sonnet 4.6, fellbacks fired 4.8% of the time, and tenant_acme is driving 42% of premium model usage." That's how you tune the policy without guesswork.

## What This Demonstrates

- Production routing logic as testable backend code — not config-as-magic
- Proper circuit-breaker state machine with half-open semantics that actually work
- Cross-provider failover by default (the failure-case design that matters most)
- Optimization weights as explicit policy, not implicit heuristic
- Capability-tagged model catalog as the foundation for everything else
- Strict-mode TypeScript with full test coverage; CI matrix on Node 20 + 22

## Future Enhancements

- Sticky-session tenancy (route the same conversation to the same backend for cache locality)
- Adaptive weight learning from observed quality outcomes
- Provider health probes via passive backend pings
- Load-balanced routing across regions for the same provider
- Webhook integration with `agentobserve` and `ai-finops-radar`
- Streaming response proxying with mid-stream failover
